echo "Subject: Pre‑Internship Project Submission – Signup, Login & OTP Pages

Dear Recruiter/Team,

I am submitting my frontend pre‑internship assignment as per the provided Figma design. The project includes:
- Signup Page with validation, password toggle, and localStorage persistence.
- Login Page with mobile/email authentication, password toggle, and OTP generation.
- OTP Verification Page with numeric keypad, countdown timer, masked user info, and error handling.

The project has been developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and lucide‑react, with localStorage implemented as required.

GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/Noor27113/pre-internship-frontend]
Netlify Deployment: [https://pre-internship-frontend.netlify.app]

I have ensured pixel‑perfect alignment with the Figma design, responsive layouts, and recruiter‑grade polish. Please let me know if you need any additional details.

Best regards,
Nur Mohammad Ansari"
